# Frontend Mentor - Tip calculator app

![Design preview for the Tip calculator app coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge. I solved this challenge using vanilla Javascript, CSS and HTML.  The logic behind the solution might not be the best, and it needs a lot of imprementation and refactoring. Most of the functions and tools that I used were for studying purpose.

I'm uploading all my projects to track my evolution. Thanks!
